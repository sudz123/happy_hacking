                            Halloween is the season for little ghosts and goblins to take to the streets, asking for candy and scaring one another silly.
                            Spooky stories are told around fires, scary movies appear in theaters and pumpkins are expertly
                            (and not-so-expertly) carved into jack-o'-lanterns. It is important to point that 
                            this day is not tradional in some countries like Brazil, even though some brazilians
                            like to celebrate this date going to parties (mostly adults and teens).

                            These days Halloween is not usually considered a religious holiday. It is primarily a fun
                            day for children. Children dress
                            up in costumes like people did a thousand years ago. But instead of worrying about evil
                            spirits,
                            they go from house to house. They knock on doors and say "trick or treat." The owner of
                            each
                            house gives candy or something special to each trick or treater. Halloween is also often
                            synonymous
                            with horror movies and haunted houses.

                        Borrowing from Irish and English traditions, Americans began to dress up in costumes and go house to house 
                        asking for food or money, a practice that eventually became today’s “trick-or-treat” tradition. 
                        Young women believed that on Halloween they could divine the name or appearance of their future husband 
                        by doing tricks with yarn, apple parings or mirrors.On Halloween, when it was believed that ghosts came 
                        back to the earthly world, people thought that they would encounter ghosts if they left their homes. 
                        To avoid being recognized by these ghosts, people would wear masks when they left their homes after dark 
                        so that the ghosts would mistake them for fellow spirits.
