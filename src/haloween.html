                    <p class="mt-3">
                        Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of All Hallows' Evening),
                        also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All
                        Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in a number of
                        countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast
                        of All Hallows' Day. It begins the three-day observance of
                        Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to
                        remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and
                        also known as Allhalloween, All Hallows' Eve, or All
                        Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in a number of
                        countries on 31 October, the eve of the Western Christian feast
                        of All Hallows' Day. <br><br>It begins the three-day observance of
                        Allhallowtide, the time in the liturgical year dedicated to
                        remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and
                        all the faithful departed.
                        
                        Despite its religious origin, Halloween has, especially in more recent
                        years, stirred up some controversy among various religious groups. For
                        many, Halloween represents a worship of evil forces, which some 
                        consider to be against the will of a higher, almighty power.

                        Halloween is the season for little ghosts and goblins to take
                        to the streets, asking for candy and scaring one another silly.
                        Spooky stories are told around fires, scary movies appear in
                        theaters and pumpkins are expertly (and not-so-expertly) carved
                        into jack-o'-lanterns.

                    <p class="mt-3">
                        These days Halloween is not usually considered a religious holiday. It is
                        primarily a fun day for children. Children dress up in costumes like
                        people did a thousand years ago. But instead of worrying about evil spirits,
                        they go from house to house. They knock on doors and say "trick or treat."
                        The owner of each house gives candy or something special to each trick or treater.
                        Halloween is also often synonymous with horror movies and haunted houses.
