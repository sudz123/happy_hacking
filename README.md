# :construction_worker: About

My name is Sudarshan Kamath and I am hosting this repository for the month of October, 2018. The idea is to create a website over the month, about Open-Source Programming. This site is open to all forms of suggestions. Happy contributing!

If you want to see what the site looks like you can through github.
All you need to do it click the HTML file you want to view, click the button Raw and then change the url. You need to remove ".githubusercontent" and replace it with just "git" so the link looks like this - https://rawgit.com

- UPDATE \*

If you want to continue using the rawgit trick on another project, you might need to switch to just using githack. Like with gitraw, all you need to do is change "githubusercontent" for "githack" the link now looks like this - https://raw.githack.com/

Here is what our homepage looks like!
https://rawgit.com/sudz123/Happy_Hacking/master/src/home.html
https://raw.githack.com/sudz123/Happy_Hacking/master/src/home.html
(both show the same thing, one using rawgit and the other using githack)

# :bookmark: IMPORTANT :bookmark:

Since this repository is gaining some momentum, I expect good grammar in all PRs. I also expect proper comments in the code. The code could be trivial with a small change, that is totally fine. **When making changes to existing files, make sure you do not add more than one feature or change more than one component in a PR!** Also these file descriptions should be helpful:

- [_src_](src) contains all the code.
- _.html_ files like these should not have css or javascript code ideally. If they do then remove it and add to respective folders.
- [_styles_](src/style) I want all the css files in this folder with proper nomenclature.
- [_Images_](img) I want all images in this within sub-folders in this folder, according to the page they are on.
- **THE MORE THE STRUCTURED YOUR CODE IS, THE EASIER IT IS FOR ME TO REVIEW, THE HIGHER CHANCES THAT IT WILL BE MERGED**.
